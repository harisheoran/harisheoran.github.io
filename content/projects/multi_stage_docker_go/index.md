# Simple Web Server in GO

## Containerization using Multi-Stage Docker Build
Multi-Stage Docker Build or Distroless Image is a concept of creating image in multiple stages.

We build a docker image of a simple go web server using the concept of multi-stage docker build.

### The Evolution: From 815MB to 6.71MB üöÄ

A simple Go web server docker image is 815 MB which is quite large.

Enter the magic of multi-stage Docker builds. By breaking down the build process into distinct stages, we've successfully trimmed down our image to a sleek 6.71MB. That's a jaw-dropping 99.17% reduction in size, making our deployment faster, more scalable, and resource-efficient.

How we build the image?
We divide this image into 2 stages, 
- Build Stage
- Production Stage

### Build Stage
In this stage, we take *golang* as Base image and install all the dependencies it needs and create a single binary and we don't define our entrypoint here.

```
FROM golang:1.21 as build

WORKDIR /app

COPY go.mod ./

RUN go mod download

COPY *.go ./

RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .

```

### Production Stage
In this stage we take *scratch* as Base image, it is a bare minimum image to run our binary.

And copy the binary build from build stage and execute it as an entrypoint.

> We don't need golang image in our production, we only need the executable binary.

```
FROM scratch

COPY --from=build /app/main .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "./main" ]
```


#### The Command That Did the Magic ‚ú®
Build the executable binary.

``` 
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .
```
Breaking down the command:

- CGO_ENABLED=0: Disabling CGO for a statically linked binary.
- GOOS=linux: Targeting a Linux operating system for compatibility.
- go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .: Building a binary optimized for minimal size.

## Benefits Beyond Size: Security Boost üõ°Ô∏è

Reducing image size isn't just about efficiency ‚Äì it's also about security. Our final image contains only the essentials needed to run the Go application, minimizing attack surfaces and potential vulnerabilities. With fewer dependencies and a smaller footprint, our web server is now more resilient and secure in a production environment.
