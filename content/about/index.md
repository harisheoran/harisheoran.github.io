Hello there, I am Harish, I am an software developer who finds great joy in leveraging a variety of tools to create exceptional solutions. As an Android app developer proficient in Kotlin, I am deeply passionate about harnessing the power of modern Android app architecture. Additionally, my expertise extends to utilizing backend services like Firebase to enhance the functionality and performance of my applications.

Being a Linux enthusiast, I relish exploring its vast ecosystem and harnessing its capabilities to optimize my development workflow.

I am also a firm believer in the importance of version control systems like Git and GitHub, which I integrate seamlessly into my app development process to ensure efficient collaboration and code management.

Furthermore, my journey began with web development, where I cultivated a strong foundation in creating dynamic and visually appealing websites. This background has equipped me with valuable insights into front-end technologies and web development best practices.

Driven by my passion for software development and armed with a versatile toolkit encompassing Kotlin, modern Android app architecture, Firebase, Linux, Git, GitHub, and web development, I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to projects that push the boundaries of innovation.
