## About
I‚Äôm Harish, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems. With experience in software development and DevOps, I thrive on turning complex challenges into streamlined solutions.

I love diving into backend development, creating robust CLI tools, crafting seamless pipelines, and taming Kubernetes clusters. Automation is my game‚ÄîI believe in automating the boring stuff so teams can focus on what they do best.

My toolkit includes cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes. I‚Äôm well-versed in Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Ansible, and I enjoy setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, ArgoCD, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions. When Kubernetes feels like a puzzle, I turn to Helm Charts to simplify deployments.

Beyond engineering, I‚Äôm a Linux enthusiast and love exploring open-source projects, large language models, and hardware servers. When I‚Äôm not wrangling servers, you can find me on the üèècricket field, bringing my strategic mindset and team spirit to the game as a right-handed batsman and medium pacer.
