## About

🚀 Hello, I’m Harish, a DevOps Engineer by day, Go Developer by...well, also by day (and sometimes night 😄).  I’m passionate about backend development, building robust CLI tools, crafting seamless pipelines, and taming Kubernetes clusters, all while automating the boring stuff so teams can focus on what they do best.  From orchestrating clouds on AWS and GCP to taming Kubernetes clusters and Docker swarms, I live for the challenge of turning chaos into efficiency.

⚙️ I work with all the cool tools—Terraform and Ansible for Infrastructure as Code, Jenkins, ArgoCD, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Helm Charts for those days when K8s feels like a puzzle. Whether it’s crafting scripts in Go or building robust backend systems and APIs, I love working at the intersection of code and ops.

💻 Linux is my daily driver, and automation is my game. I'm also into open-source, LLMs, and hardware servers—anything that lets me geek out over new tech and make life a little smoother.

🏏 When I’m not wrangling servers, you can find me on the cricket field, playing as a right-handed batsman and spinner. Whether it’s engineering a perfect CI/CD pipeline or spinning a cricket ball, precision is key!
